//! The render family's state objects, made from core's values and the translator's descriptors:
//! sampler states, depth-stencil states and render pipeline states (`GpuDevice`'s creators of
//! them call here).
//!
//! - **A value's raw properties** become the runtime's types in the value's order, each named by
//!   its setter: a raw value no Metal enumerator is dies at that setter
//!   ([`crate::gpu::metal_value`]), as the runtime's types cannot hold it.
//! - **A sampler state** of equal requests is one object while it lives, as Metal's is on this
//!   host ([`crate::gpu::resource::sampler_state`]). The value's resource index, which core sets
//!   without the force flag, places the state at that ID: Metal on this host places a sampler at
//!   an index set so (`render_objects_placement_sampler`: index 7 gives `gpuResourceID` 7), and the
//!   runtime's placement is that ID (index 0 is plain allocation, as Metal's is). Plain
//!   allocation hands out the IDs Metal's does, as the runtime numbers them: Metal's
//!   device keeps a sampler ID of its own for good from its first command queue, indirect
//!   command buffer or texture of its own memory (sampler states made after a texture take 2 and
//!   on, or 3 and on with 2 reserved); and a pipeline state, as it is made, takes one for each of
//!   its functions' constexpr samplers, texture reads and texture writes, and the device's own
//!   for a render state with a fragment function made before that, unless a live holder holds an
//!   equal one. The state holds them, as do every function object of its functions and every
//!   live library of their bytes, and each goes back with its last holder. The constexpr samplers
//!   of the visible functions a stage links come after the stage's own, as Metal numbers them.
//!   Where it does not number them as Metal does, the runtime announces
//!   `linked-sampler-numbering`, which dies ([`crate::answer::DIES`]): a stage that links two or
//!   more with constexpr samplers, whose order Metal itself does not decide, and a function a
//!   table can hold whose samplers the runtime cannot read, among them. One linked function
//!   alone, of `functions` or `privateFunctions`, called or not, is numbered as Metal numbers it.
//!   No guest form here links a function. This platform's libraries, functions and states hold the
//!   runtime's exactly as long as the guest's handles to them live, so its sampler IDs are Metal's
//!   (`tests::sampler_ids_follow_pipeline_holders_as_metals`).
//! - **A pipeline's refusals** that Metal answers with an `NSError` are one here
//!   ([`pipeline_error`]): what the compile finds wrong with the functions or the descriptor, a
//!   vertex function writing a point size under a line or triangle topology, a function Metal's
//!   compiler itself refuses on this device, an import no dynamic library supplies, and a state
//!   that supports indirect command buffers whose functions use a direct texture or sampler
//!   argument. The rest die at the selector: an ID past Metal's limit, which ends Metal's process,
//!   a gap of the runtime (an unspecialized function constant among them, which Metal aborts for;
//!   and a function's SIMD-group operations in a stage the runtime does not take them in, a vertex
//!   function's on MoltenVK, which Metal makes and for which device info's key 33 answers no,
//!   [`crate::gpu::caps`]), and its other refusals, as Metal raises at none. Such a death's line
//!   also names the descriptor's formats (`formats`: its colour attachments' with their write
//!   masks, its depth and stencil, its vertex attributes'), which the runtime's error does not
//!   carry. A binary archive miss cannot happen: core's descriptors list no archive.
//!
//!   Measured on the M3 Max (macOS 26.7, one case per process, plain and under `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER`):
//!   the compute creators (both selectors), the render creator and the tile creator answer nil and
//!   an `NSError` of code 3 for a render state setter on an indirect render command
//!   (`set_cull_mode`, `set_depth_stencil_state`) in a kernel, vertex, fragment or tile function,
//!   and for a fragment function's read of a program-scope `thread_index_in_quadgroup` (a read of
//!   `thread_index_in_simdgroup` or `threads_per_simdgroup` there is made); and of code 2
//!   ("Undefined symbols:") for a function whose import the library at its install name lacks, or
//!   whose install name names no file. The functions that draw without a setter, and those whose
//!   library exports the import, are made. The runtime refuses a fragment function's read of a
//!   program-scope `thread_index_in_simdgroup` as a gap of its own (`Lowering(StageIo)`), which
//!   dies where Metal makes the pipeline. The compute and render creators answer nil and an
//!   `NSError` of code 3 for a descriptor with `supportIndirectCommandBuffers` whose kernel,
//!   vertex or fragment function uses a `[[texture(n)]]` or `[[sampler(n)]]` argument once Metal
//!   links the pipeline ("Fragment shader cannot be used with indirect command buffers", naming
//!   the fragment function alone where both use one): Metal makes the state where a vertex
//!   function's read reaches only outputs the fragment function does not read, or there is no
//!   fragment function, and where a fragment function's reaches only a colour no attachment
//!   writes (none, colour 0 `Invalid`, or a write mask of none or of none of its format's channels,
//!   measured). The runtime refuses the same states with Metal's error, deciding the use
//!   by liveness as Metal links, and the creators answer that `NSError`. A use only a rule the
//!   runtime keeps beyond Metal keeps is unproven (`Error::Unproven`): an endless loop, stack
//!   memory, a gated-off mesh output, or a colour whose attachment's write is unmeasured
//!   (`UnmeasuredColorWrite`: a mask of some of the format's channels but not all, a format of
//!   fewer than four channels even written in full, an unspecialized mask, or a dual-source second
//!   colour under blending that reads no second source). Metal's answer is unmeasured, and the
//!   creator dies, naming the stage and the rule. The compile layer decides the use from the
//!   arguments' roles alone, so an argument whose reflection Metal's answer has not been measured
//!   for decides nothing; where it refuses to decide (the decode's or the
//!   specialization's own refusal), the runtime refuses the state, unproven, and the creator dies
//!   there, naming the refusal. Once the runtime made such a state, the creator asks the compile
//!   layer as the runtime did, and dies naming a refusal there too
//!   ([`direct_arguments_decided`], [`kernel_direct_arguments_decided`]). The runtime
//!   refuses a render state with rasterization off whose vertex function returns a value with
//!   Metal's error too (`UnrasterizedVertexReturn`, code 3). With rasterization off the descriptor
//!   keeps the fragment function, which the runtime checks as Metal links it and leaves out of the
//!   Vulkan compile: it answers Metal's error (code 3) where a written colour attachment keeps the
//!   fragment function's read of a `stage_in` input, which no vertex function writes then, or, with
//!   `supportIndirectCommandBuffers`, its direct texture or sampler, and where the function writes
//!   depth with no depth attachment; it makes the state otherwise, as Metal does (measured:
//!   `unrasterized_states_are_metals`).
//!
//!   The `NSError`'s domain is the driver's (`AGXMetalG15X_M1` on the M3 Max; another GPU family's
//!   driver names another), and its text names the intrinsic or the symbol, which the runtime's
//!   refusal does not always carry. Core reads a pipeline creator's `NSError` only for its
//!   description, which goes into a log line and the creation's error string
//!   (`resources::manager::create::pipeline`): no domain, code or text reaches the guest or the
//!   host. So the `NSError` here carries the runtime's domain and text, with Metal's code; the
//!   refusal, in place of a death, is what the guest observes.
//! - **A sampler's descriptor** is a debug line under this module's target
//!   (`REIMS_VGPU_LOG=debug`, or `warn,reims_vgpu_vulkan::gpu::states=debug`), written before its
//!   first setter ([`Sampler`]): each property of the guest's record, so a death at one setter
//!   (`setMinFilter:` of a filter the runtime has no enumerator of, say) shows the whole
//!   descriptor. The record holds no LOD bias, which only a binding's setter takes, and no label.
//!   The line is a diagnostic: it changes nothing the guest or the host sees, and with the
//!   target's debug lines off nothing formats it.
//! - **A cubic sampler** (a min or mag filter of 2, `MTLSamplerMinMagFilterCubic`) is the
//!   runtime's `Cubic`. Without a mip filter the runtime samples through it as a bicubic sampler
//!   of its address modes and border colour, whatever its other filter, and announces
//!   `bicubic-filter-arithmetic` at the dispatch or draw, which dies at its selector, naming the
//!   kind ([`crate::answer::DIES`]). With a mip filter, under mirror clamp to the edge, with a
//!   minimum or maximum reduction, or with anisotropy, the runtime refuses the dispatch or draw
//!   that samples through it, which dies at its selector, naming the refusal, where Metal
//!   samples; and so under mirrored repeat where the function also gathers through it, or samples
//!   in pixel coordinates or a 1D texture. The state itself is made, as Metal makes it. Through
//!   an argument buffer, a stage other than a fragment one tests each sampler it reaches, and
//!   the runtime fails the command buffer of a function that reached a cubic one, which dies
//!   where its failure is first read ([`crate::gpu::command`]), where Metal samples; one that
//!   never reaches a cubic sampler runs as Metal's while a cubic state is alive. A fragment
//!   stage tests none: while any cubic state is alive on the device, whether or not an argument
//!   buffer holds it, a draw whose fragment stage samples through an argument buffer's sampler,
//!   of any filter, dies at its selector, naming the refusal, as the runtime lists every live
//!   sampler state as an argument sampler and refuses that stage while the list holds a cubic
//!   one. The runtime lists the live states again as a command buffer commits, and fails it,
//!   whether or not a function reaches the state it leaves out, where a command of any stage
//!   that samples through an argument buffer's sampler meets more states than its set-1 sampler
//!   arrays (at most 65536 elements each, fewer where the device's limits are) or its sampler
//!   tables hold, or such a draw meets a cubic state made after it was encoded: that dies where
//!   its failure is first read (`UnlistedArgumentSampler`, [`crate::gpu::command`]), where
//!   Metal's functions reach every live state by its ID. A command a host step records after
//!   the commit, which no commit lists, fails it the same way where it meets more states than
//!   its set-1 sampler arrays hold.
//! - **A texture slot sampled through an argument buffer's sampler**, whatever its filter, is a
//!   function the runtime refuses where its pipeline state is made (`ArgumentBufferTextures`),
//!   which dies there, where Metal makes and runs it. A texture an argument buffer holds, sampled
//!   through a sampler it holds, samples as Metal's does.
//! - **A sampler's raw border colour** is the colour Metal samples for it
//!   (`rt::sampler_border_color`): Metal takes any value and keeps its low two bits, 3 sampling
//!   as transparent black.
//! - **A sampler's or a depth-stencil state's refusal** dies at the selector: Metal makes a
//!   state of any descriptor these take (measured: a sampler of `maxAnisotropy` 0 or 17, of a
//!   minimum LOD clamp past the maximum, or of border colour 3, and a depth-stencil state of the
//!   default descriptor, each made, no exception raised), and so does the runtime of each of
//!   those.
//! - **Labels** are diagnostics: a pipeline state takes its descriptor's or its value's
//!   (`PipelineOptions::label`), which no answer to the guest reads and the runtime compiles
//!   nothing of.

//! `BlockEnv`: what every callout of core's sees, whichever thread runs it.
//!
//! A queue's block, a source's handler, a once's block and a Metal completion handler are callouts
//! an exception never unwinds out of: a raise in one with no handler of its own dies at the raise,
//! whatever handlers the thread had (measured for `dispatch_sync` on macOS 26.7). Its code holds
//! under [`Hold::NONE`](crate::rt::Hold::NONE), with no holder: a callout is `Send` and its
//! caller's hold is not, so none reaches it. While a queue's block runs, the thread owns the queue,
//! and a `sync` onto a queue it owns dies. So a queue's block or a completion handler enters:
//! - the thread's ownership chain: the queue a worker's block is of, a sync caller's chain plus
//!   the queue, none on a foreign thread;
//! - the "ours" mark, so a panic there aborts before unwinding (6.5): on a platform worker, and
//!   on Metal's thread for a completion handler, which would otherwise unwind into Metal.
//!
//! Dropping the environment restores the caller's chain and mark.

//! The resource manager: one per task, owning the task's per-kind object caches and handing
//! the guest's objects out by reference.
//!
//! [`ResourceManager`] holds eight caches ([`cache`]) keyed by the guest's object reference: the
//! resources (buffers, heaps, ICBs, textures) and the Metal states. A lookup of a reference not
//! yet cached reads the guest's object entry and record and makes the object ([`create`] for the
//! buffers, heaps and Metal states, whose kinds are [`states`]; [`texture`] for the textures;
//! the ICB manager for the ICBs). [`flush`] writes dirty resources
//! back before a suspend, [`reserve`] reserves the guest's argument-buffer indices, [`lookup`]
//! is the deserializer's object lookup, [`resolver`] the function resolver Metal calls while it
//! deserializes a pipeline descriptor, and [`icb`] the indirect command buffers' creation and
//! CPU paging.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! What callers and the guest observe, each held by the tests named (under each module's
//! `tests`):
//! - **One cache per kind**, released in a fixed order when the manager goes: samplers,
//!   depth-stencil states, render and compute pipelines, fences, rate maps, resources, then (after
//!   the lookup) the functions; each cache in its list order
//!   (`tests::maps_release_in_order_functions_after_the_lookup`).
//! - **Reference 0** is nil for every kind and flows on
//!   (`cache::tests::get_object::reference_zero_is_nil_without_touching_the_list`).
//! - **A handed-out object stays alive** while the caller holds it, past a delete
//!   (`cache::tests::get_object::a_handed_out_object_outlives_its_delete_while_held`).
//! - **Creation holds the recursive lock**; a creation that looks up another reference re-enters
//!   it, and one that looks up its own recurses without detection
//!   (`cache::tests::new_object::a_nested_creation_reenters_the_lock`,
//!   `cache::tests::new_object::a_self_reference_recurses_without_detection`). Cached lookups never
//!   wait for a creation on another thread (`cache::lock_scope_tests`).
//! - **A delete that clears** zeroes the placement slot with one 16-byte store, whether or not
//!   anything was cached (`cache::tests::clear_placement::the_clear_is_one_16_byte_store`).
//! - **Flush order**: CPU evictions first, then one command buffer with the blit evictions, then
//!   the compute evictions, each in cache order; an eviction's raise is logged and the walk
//!   goes on (`flush::tests`).
//! - **Reservations**: textures, samplers, then ICBs, each only if any; pinned buffers are made
//!   and discarded first; a raise skips the reservations, and what the walk held goes on with
//!   it (`reserve::tests::a_raise_in_the_discards_reserves_nothing`).
//! - **The address and pipeline registries** keep the newest registration and are never
//!   unregistered (`cache::tests::registries`).
//! - **A lookup failure** logs and raises [`RaiseKind::Lookup`], except the untyped resource
//!   lookup, which answers nil (`lookup::tests`).
